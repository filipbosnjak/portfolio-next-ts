    In Java, <span style="color: #185bc9">transactions</span> are a way to manage a group of operations as a <span style="color: #185bc9">single unit of work</span>, ensuring that either
    all the operations within the group are executed successfully, or none of them are executed at all.
    Transactions are commonly used when dealing with databases or any other systems that require data consistency and integrity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The key concepts in transactions are known under abbreviation <span style="color: #185bc9"><b>ACID</b></span>:
</p>
<br>
<p>
    1. <span style="color: #185bc9">Atomicity</span> ensures that all the operations within a transaction are treated
    as a single indivisible unit. If any part of the transaction fails,
    the whole transaction is rolled back, and the data is left unchanged.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    2. <span style="color: #185bc9">Consistency</span> guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
    It enforces integrity constraints, ensuring that data remains in a valid and consistent state after the
    transaction completes successfully.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    3. <span style="color: #185bc9">Isolation</span> is taking care of that each transaction is isolated from other concurrent transactions.
    Transactions should not interfere with each other, and each one should feel like it's running in isolation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    4. <span style="color: #185bc9">Durability</span> ensures that once a transaction is committed, the changes made to the data persist even in the face
    of system failures, such as power outages or crashes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Lets look at some examples in Spring Boot application.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    First we need to enable transaction manager in a configuration component and register <span style="color: #32de84">PlatformTransactionManager</span> in the application context
    like bellow:
</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; ">
    <img  src="/img/transactionmanager.png" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 10px" alt="Transaction manager configuration"/>
    <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Transaction manager configuration</i></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
    Then we can start using <span style="color: #32de84">@Transactional</span> annotation on our classes and methods. This annotation applied
    on a method will ensure that all the steps in that method complete or none of them. If the transaction fails at any step it will rollback
    all the operations it did before.
</p>
<br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; ">
    <img  src="/img/transactional.png" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain; border-radius: 10px" alt="@Transactional example"/>
    <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>@Transactional example</i></p>
</div>

<p>
    In the example above, neither of two users will be persisted to the database because at the end we are throwing CustomException, whick
    extends Exception class. In @Transactional annotation we can specify e.g. on which exceptions we want to rollback all operations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Important thing to note is that transactions are not limited to just database operations.
    You can use similar concepts and frameworks for managing transactions involving other resources like <i>files</i>, <i>message</i> <i>queues,</i> etc. The key is to ensure that related operations are treated as a single unit with the <span style="color: #185bc9">ACID</span> properties in mind.
